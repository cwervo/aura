# Aura Browser Prototype

This project is a prototype of a web browser with experimental support for decentralized identity through the AT Protocol.

## Browser Prototype Functionality

The Aura Browser has the following features:

*   **Webview:** Renders web pages using the `webview_flutter` plugin.
*   **OmniBar:** An address bar that can be used to navigate to websites or resolve AT Protocol handles.
*   **Favorites Bar:** A bar with favorite websites for quick navigation.
*   **AT Protocol Handle Resolution:** The browser can resolve AT Protocol handles (e.g., `@alice.com`) to their corresponding profiles on bsky.app.
